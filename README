The EE5SEQ-ARP is a project I did for university. It is a MIDI sequencer capable of recording and storing 32 sequences of up to 128 notes long. 
I made it on proto-board and don't expect anyone to ever make this thing, though feel free to play around with the code or take stuff from the schematic!

It is written for the PIC18F2550 using a custom board for it.
